# Disaster Prediction & Rescue Prioritization System

## 💡 Project Vision

This project aims to build an intelligent disaster management system capable of predicting interconnected natural disasters (e.g., rainfall ➝ floods/landslides) and streamlining rescue operations using a user-prioritized alert system using topography.

Designed initially as a hackathon idea, this system is intended to evolve into a full-fledged academic, research, or real-world application — focusing on saving lives through better preparedness and smarter technology.



## 🌍 Real-World Problem

Disasters are often interconnected. For example:
- **Heavy Rainfall** can lead to **landslides**, **floods**, or even **infrastructure collapse**.
- **Delayed rescue** operations often result from poor **priority management** and **lack of real-time data**.

Current systems are reactive, not predictive.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. **Disaster Prediction Engine**
- Analyzes historical + real-time data (e.g., weather, soil, elevation)
- Predicts chains of disasters (e.g., rainfall ➝ saturated soil ➝ landslide)
- Visualizes risk zones using topographic maps

### 2. **Emergency Prioritization System**
- Users can press **Red**, **Orange**, or **Yellow** emergency buttons based on urgency
  - 🔴 Red = Life-threatening emergency
  - 🟠 Orange = Trapped but stable
  - 🟡 Yellow = Minor help needed
- System aggregates requests for **rescue prioritization**

### 3. **Risk Analysis Dashboard for Authorities**
- Real-time map + data dashboard
- Prioritized rescue list based on location + severity
- Prediction overlays and alerts

## 🔧 Tech Stack (Frontend + AI only for now)

| Layer     | Tools                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React.js, Tailwind CSS, Mapbox or Leaflet    |
| AI/ML     | Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Colab     |
| Data      | CSVs, Weather APIs, GIS data (open datasets) |

---

## 🔁 Simple Workflow

1. User presses a button (Red/Orange/Yellow).
2. Frontend displays predicted disaster zones (based on AI model).
3. Risk levels visualized on a map.
4. Authorities (future feature) can access a priority dashboard.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build MVP using AI + Frontend only (no backend needed yet)
- Use as a research base for AI & Robotics lab
- Future: expand with backend, user accounts, real-time APIs
